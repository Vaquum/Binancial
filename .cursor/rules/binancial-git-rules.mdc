This is required whenever the project already has `.git`.

- Always create a new branch for new issue 
- If I give you issue always use Github MCP to get the issue
- When creating a new branch, always do it from `main`
- When creating a new branch, always pull the latest to `main` first
- Never make changes directly to `main` branch
- Always follow conventional commits with commit messages
- Always name PR as per conventional commits
- Always name branches as per conventional commits
- Always make pull request with new branch before concluding the prompt
- Keep committing fixes to the same branch until I've accepeted all your changes
- Do not switch branch before the current branch is deleted from origin
- If the prompt was a Github issue, make sure the PR closes that issue automatically (i.e. Closes #xx)
